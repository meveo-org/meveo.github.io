|Max Upload Size
|meveo.fileUpload.limitInMb
|This property sets the maximum file size the JSF components can handle. The maximum value it can accept is 100MB and is defined in JBoss application server in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/undertow-handlers.conf. Which means, if we set this property to 150MB and uploaded a file with that size the system should throw an error.
