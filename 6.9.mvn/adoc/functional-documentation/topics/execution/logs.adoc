=== Logs
==== Log explorer
The log explorer can be accessed through the menu at _Execution > Logs > Log explorer_.

The page has two inputs:

* *Log file*: the location of the log file. This corresponds to the `meveo.log.file` property of the `meveo-admin.properties` file.
* *Offset*: the number of lines to offset. Default value is 50.

And 4 buttons: 

* *Read*: it will display the last X lines (X = *Offset*) to the console
* *Refresh*: only appears once *Read* or *Continuous reading* has been hit once. Allows to append into the console the logs written between the previous refresh / read
* *Continuous reading*: append new logs to the console every seconds
* *Pause*: only appears when *Continuous reading* is active. Pauses the continous reading

/!\ If you chose a "0" offset and you click the *Read* button, nothing will happen until you hit the *Refresh* button /!\
