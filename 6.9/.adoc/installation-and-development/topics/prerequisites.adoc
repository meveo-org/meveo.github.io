== Installation Guide

This guide is intended for Windows users. Minor changes to the instructions must be done to become applicable to other operating systems.

=== Java

. Install or extract the OpenJDK in your PC.
. Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME, make sure it points to where you installed the OpenJDK. In Windows explorer, right click on This PC / Properties / Advance system settings / Environment variables / New. https://czetsuya-tech.blogspot.com/2020/04/how-to-add-java-home-in-windows-environment-variables.html[Refer to this guide].
. Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin in the Windows Path environment variable. https://czetsuya-tech.blogspot.com/2020/04/how-to-add-java-binary-folder-to-windows-execution-path.html[Refer to this guide].
. Open a Windows command prompt and type "java -version", hit enter. The Java version installed on your system should be shown.

=== Git

. Download and install Git.

=== Maven

. Download and extract the maven archive into your PC.
. Add the M2_HOME with value pointing to where you extract maven to your Windows environment variable. See what we did in Java above. 
Add the %M2_HOME%\bin folder to your Windows environment path just as we did with Java above.
. Open a Windows command prompt and type "mvn -version", hit enter. Just like Java it should give us the version of maven installed.

=== PostgreSQL

. Download and install PostgreSQL. Take note of the admin password as we will use it later.

=== PGAdmin

. Download and install PGAdmin.
. Open PGAdmin, it might ask you for a master password. Enter a password and make sure to remember it.
. In the left panel, expand Servers / PostgreSQL 9.5.
. Right click Login/Group Roles and select Create / Login/Group Role.
. Under General tab set Name=meveo.
. Under Description tab set Password=meveo.
. Under Privileges tab toggle Can login and Superuser.
. Hit Save.
. Back in the left panel, right click on Databases and select Create / Database.
. Under database tab set Database=meveo, Owner=meveo.
. Hit Save.

include::option1.adoc[]

=== Eclipse

. Download the eclipse installer.
. Run the installer and select the Eclipse for JavaEE developers.

==== Install JBoss Tools Plugin

. Run Eclipse IDE.
. Open menu Help / Eclipse Marketplace.
. In the Find text field enter "jboss".
. Find JBoss Tools and click Install.
. Don't install all the components, select or filter maven, egit and jboss as.

==== Add both the Keycloak and Wildfly Server for Debugging

. Open the Server tab by clicking Window / Show View / Other and filter for server.
. Select servers, a new tab should open.
. Right click on the server panel, select New / Server and select Wildfly 15.
. Click Next, select Create a new runtime.
. Click Next, and browse the directory where you installed Wildfly - WILDFLY_HOME.
. In the Configuration file field select standalone-full.xml. This is the one we modified earlier.
. Click Next and then Finish.

*Do the same with Keycloak.

Now you can start running either the Keycloak and Wildfly server in debug mode by right clicking on it and selecting Debug. You can click the Debug icon too.

=== Cloning the Meveo Project

This is done inside Eclipse IDE. Since we have installed egit component from JBoss Tools plugin, we can use it to checkout from Github.

. Open Window / Show View / Other and filter for git.
. Select both Git Repositories and Git Staging. Two new panels should open.
. Open Git Repositories.
. Right click and then select Clone a Git Repository or click the green icon in the top right corner with the same label.
. In the URI enter git@github.com:meveo-org/meveo.git, click Next.
. A selection of branch that you wanted to checkout should appear. By default all branches are selected. Click Next.
. Select the directory where you want to checkout the project, click Finish.
. Once the cloning is done, meveo project should appear in your Git Repositories.
. Right click on the meveo repository and select Import Maven Projects.
. Make sure that all projects are selected. You can select a working set (use for grouping projects) and then hit finish.
. Meveo projects should be visible in your Package or Project explorer, whichever is open.
. Now you can start coding.

=== Deploying Meveo to Wildfly

. Open the server tab once again.
. Select Add and Remove.
. Select meveo-admin-web, click Finish.
. Debug or start the server.
. Open the console log from Window / Show View / Console.
. If no error is shown, you should be able to access meveo from the URL http://localhost:8080/meveo.
. Login using the account meveo.admin / meveo.
